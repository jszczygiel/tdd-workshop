What we thought is enough

1. we need board to play
2. it has to have n columns and n rows
3. columns and rows should be equal
4. Game has to have 2 players
5. Win scenarios:
	- n signs in a column
	- n sings in a diagonal
	- n sings in a row
6. Putting sign is possible in x,y coordinates if field is empty
7. Game has turns where players play after each other

What we really needed
1. we need board to play
2. it has to have n columns and n rows
3. columns and rows should be equal
4. Game has to have board and 2 players 
4.1 Players cannot be null
4.2 Player has to be differnet
5. Win scenarios:
	- n signs in a column
	- n sings in a diagonal
	- n sings in a row
6. Putting sign is possible in x,y coordinates if field is empty
7. Game has turns where players play after each other
7.1 Each turn changes player, so same player cannot go twice
